/**
* n cows
* deck: n * m cards. numbered from 0 to n*m-1
* m cards to each cow
* play 1 card per round
* determine permutation (p) of length n, so that pi cow will be the ith cow to place a card
* permutation of length n: contains each integer from 1 to n exactly once
* To place a card, the number of the card must be grater that the number on the center pile (starting at -1)
* Does there exist p such that it is possible for all of his cows to empty their deck after playing all m rounds of the game?
* If so, output any valid p. Otherwise, output âˆ’1

// GAME SIMULATION SOLUTION: If the cow order is consistent every round, then it is possible to empty the deck
// Consistent: never the same cow appears twice in the solution array, which is a fixed size and the values are constantly being updated
